## About
Hello! Welcome to my website!

I'm Wentong Sun, a second-year master student at Department of Economics, Wuhan University.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Development Economics and Political Economics. I integrate structural estimation with empirical methods, employing laboratory experiments to collect primary data that reveals causal mechanisms underlying economic behaviors.
