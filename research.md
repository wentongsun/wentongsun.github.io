<!--"Buying in Small Quantities", with Yuzhi Yao. 
<details>
<summary><u>Abstract</u></summary> 
<p> Dollar stores feature products sold in small sizes, which are not necessarily cheaper in terms of unit price. The behavior of purchasing in smaller quantities, especially among low-income consumers, is puzzling given the quantity discount associated with bulk-buying. To unravel this phenomenon, we develop a structural model to disentangle potential explanations: limited access due to lack of transportation, liquidity constraints, and storage costs. </p>
